# Core Discovery Questions

After schema discovery, ask these questions conversationally (not all at once):

**Entity Disambiguation (Critical)**
> "When people here say 'user' or 'customer', what exactly do they mean? Are there different types?"

Listen for:
- Multiple entity types (user vs account vs organization)
- Relationships between them (1:1, 1:many, many:many)
- Which ID fields link them together

**Primary Identifiers**
> "What's the main identifier for a [customer/user/account]? Are there multiple IDs for the same entity?"

Listen for:
- Primary keys vs business keys
- UUID vs integer IDs
- Legacy ID systems

**Key Metrics**
> "What are the 2-3 metrics people ask about most? How is each one calculated?"

Listen for:
- Exact formulas (ARR = monthly_revenue Ã— 12)
- Which tables/columns feed each metric
- Time period conventions (trailing 7 days, calendar month, etc.)

**Data Hygiene**
> "What should ALWAYS be filtered out of queries? (test data, fraud, internal users, etc.)"

Listen for:
- Standard WHERE clauses to always include
- Flag columns that indicate exclusions (is_test, is_internal, is_fraud)
- Specific values to exclude (status = 'deleted')

**Common Gotchas**
> "What mistakes do new analysts typically make with this data?"

Listen for:
- Confusing column names
- Timezone issues
- NULL handling quirks
- Historical vs current state tables
